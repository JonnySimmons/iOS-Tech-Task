#  Jonathan Simmons - Task Solution

I completed the task programmatically to show my skills as a developer.

The solution completes all of the criteria specified:
- A login screen for existing users
- An accounts summary that holds the individual accounts
- A final individual accounts page
- A button that uses the APIs oneoffpayments as requested

Login and Accounts pages are fully integrated with the Networking API.

This solution fulfills what you were looking for by:
- Demonstrating the **MVVM architecture** and adheres to coding conventions and patterns
- Uses autolayout with your preference of **UIKit**, I could complete this in SwiftUI if it was required
- Implements unit tests on the Networking API with the JSONs provided
- **Accessibility** by using dynamic type has been utilised for customer experience
- iOS 13 Build target
- The Application runs without any errors
- No third party library used
- No persistence of user and login and timeout occurs via the API
- Showcased what I can produce and bring to the team

If you have any questions please feel free to ask them as I am enthusiastic to discuss this project and have enjoyed completing it.


I have attached a number of screenshots to make it easier for you to view my solution without running the project in the simulator.
